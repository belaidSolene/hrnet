# HRnet Project

### Project 14 from OpenClassrooms Developer Application - JavaScript React Track

This project aims to modernize WealthHealth's internal web application, HRnet, which is currently built with jQuery, by transforming it into a modern and efficient React application. The primary goal is to address performance and stability issues associated with the use of outdated jQuery plugins while enhancing the maintainability of the application. As part of this effort, a Modal library was specifically developed to replace the jQuery plugin used in the initial version of the project.
